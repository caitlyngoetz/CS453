	*PathChanged.PNG : Showing that I added the unzipped folder to the Path environment variable.
	*ClockRes64.PNG : Showing that I ran clockres.exe on the command line
	*AddedThreadsAndPriorityColumns.PNG : Showing that I added the threads and priority columns
	*RealtimeNotepad : Showing that the procexp.exe shows that the Notepad is running in realtime
	*ShellRealtimeNotepad.PNG : Showing that the command line also says that Notepad is running in realtime
	*TaskManagerRealtimeNotepad.PNG : Showing that task manager also shows that Notepad is running in realtime

DISCUSSION:
	Just comming off of the shell project this homework was AMAZING!! It was nice to really
	fully understand what is happening for once and to get it done in one sitting! To 
	start this homework, I had to download a Windows 10 image off of Dreamspark and make
	a VM since I am one of those Apple lackeys.  That went fairly smooth except that 
	Dreamspark didn't want to easily give up my license key to use the OS so that was
	a little frustrating to have to dig around for it.

	I didn't really have any issues with this homework besides getting use to using the 
	Windows set up.  I also ran into an issue with taking screenshots in a fast enough
	fashion to capture the NotePad when it would go into realtime priority in the procexp.
	It only wanted to stay in it for about 0.8923794237 seconds and since I had a Mac keyboard
	I didn't have the necessary PntScn (something like that) button to do a quick screenshot.

	I ended up just going to TaskManager and setting it to realtime there and it finally
	stuck in the procexp.exe so I was able to use the snipping tool to get the screenshot.

	All in all it went really easy and it was a really nice change from last week.
	I feel like I got a little bit of my confidence with technology back after being
	forcibley stripped of it last week :)

SOURCES USED:

I surfed the internet for ideas on how to take a quick screenshot but none of them ended
up working that great.  So I guess it wasn't really a source.
